# Reef NFT Marketplace

A comprehensive NFT Marketplace showcasing the power of Spheron and Reef.

## Description

This project serves as a full-fledged demonstration of a decentralized NFT marketplace. Users can mint, list, buy, and resell NFTs within a robust and decentralized ecosystem.

### Why Did We Build This?

We developed this NFT marketplace to provide a hands-on example for anyone interested in creating their own marketplace, showcasing the power of Spheron and Reef.
